2d project for testing using Unreal 5.0

This was a prototype for learning the at-the-time current tools for developing 2-D games. 
As Unreal 5.0 was just release at the time, there were not many resources on the best practices for creating a 2-D game. However, the plentiful materials for Unreal 4 seems to have carried over nicely.

This prototype currently...
o	Uses Sprite sheets, sprite books, and visual scripting (Blueprints) for character animation.
o	Has gameplay mechanics that include damage, knockback, invincibility frames (i-frames), double jump, and a basic attack.
